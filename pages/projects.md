# The Swarm @ [biotexturas][1]{: .pretty_border}

{% capture details %}
**The Swarm** is a decentralized and diverse research group that study microbes, not in an ordinary way, but through building open-source hardware (e.g. [**HomeScope**][2], an open-source robotic microscope) and playing **My Swarm**, a (biotic) game that operates on the biological process of adaptation and computation of swarming bacteria living in complex habitats.

In the gamified context of the project, The Swarm is a group of researchers-players who build their HomeScope, a microscope turned into a game console, along with the game cartridges (simple microfluidic devices) where soil bacteria grow, develop and expand over its surface. In these cell-ecosystem machines, computer vision and machine learning algorithms abstract living biological structures and map them into game elements that make up My Swarm, which creates a virtual ecology where real bacterial cultures living in different HomeScope consoles can compete and play, providing an ecological context for the directed evolution of game-winner strains.

Our vision is deeply motivated by the idea of making science accessible for everyone and decentralized, which is why we are learning how to run My Swarm on a blockchain's virtual machine and tokenize observations of natural history (strain's data) made by people.

# [HomeScope][4]{: .pretty_border} <span>&#x1F52C;</span>

{% capture details %}
![HomeScope 3D frame](/assets/images/homescope.png){: .centered_img width="350px;"}

Homemade RaspiCam/Arduino-based digital microscope system capable of recording video and image capture (time-lapse microscopy) while robotically scanning a sample. The HomeScope as a whole package is not only a DIY biologist solution for developing robotic microscopy capabilities for the home laboratory but also a means to learn (and teach) subjects across disciplines.

This open-source project was developed collectively by biotexturas and collaborators.
